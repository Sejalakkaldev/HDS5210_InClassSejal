In this week's assignment, you will need to create your own JSON document to store information about yourself and the grades you've received from week 1 to week 4 and the week 6 quiz.  That is, everything you should have received a grade for.  Then you'll need to show me you know how to navigate the JSON in that file.\n",

Setting up JSON structures and loading data into Python did not prove too complicated. However, figuring out a proper structure that would be both hierarchical and transparent did take some thought. I appreciated that the output became a more dynamic process, as one could get the grade for each assignment and post it using a loop. Checking the syntax yet ensuring that I referenced nested items properly proved to be quite difficult. In addition, I enjoyed how this project refreshed my knowledge of JSON and Python data processing as well as demonstrated the scope of proper data management. Quite an interactive approach toward learning was this!"
